              <h2> Has increased police presence in public and charter schools reduced school crime, and has this facilitated the school-to-prison pipeline? </h2>

                Impact schools were introduced by Mayor Bloomberg's administration as a school safety initiative with three ways to combat crime: 
                    <strong> "dispatching large numbers of uniformed police officers into targeted areas, cracking down on even minor incidents of disorderly behavior, and quickly punishing those who repeatedly violate the rules." </strong>
                NYPD officers who can handcuff and arrest suspects, including students, are stationed in New York City public and charter schools. What started off as 12 schools at the program's inception in January 2004 has since grown to include 50 schools across New York City. 
                <br>
                <br>
                While Impact Schools only make up <strong> 3% of New York City's public and charter schools </strong> , they are not equally distributed across all 5 boroughs. Queens has 34% of all impact schools, but these make up only 5% of all public and charter schools in Queens. Staten Island, on the other hand, has only 12% of impact schools but these make up 8% of its public and charter schools. The Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan's impact schools make up 1%, 2% and 3% of their public and charter schools respectively.

              <p> how were these impact schools selected and why? look at school attendance & crime here </p>
              <p> but race complicates this - school districts + race </p>

            <div class = "bar4" id = "content">
              <p> what is the racial distribution of young people in nyc (just chart) & does this correlate with the number of young people in juvenile system? </p>
              <p> Then looking at the impact schools themselves, has crime reduced or no? what is the racial distribution of people arrested for crime? </p>
